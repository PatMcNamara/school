This is an experimental version of a remote debugging tool
for Linux assembly language programs.

First, you need to 'compile' the kernel module (dbmodule.c)
against your current Linux (version 2.6.10) source-tree.  
Asuming your tree exists, you can do this by typing:

	$ make

Next you need to launch the 'dbserver' application from the
same directory as your executable application program:

	$ dbserver

Finally, you need to launch the 'dbserver' application from
another window, terminal, or workstation on the same local
area network:

	$ dbclient myapp <arguments>

or
	$ dbclient [hostname:]myapp <arguments>


Press <SPACE> to single-step.  Press 'H' or '?' to see
additional command-options that have been implemented.

Report 'bugs' to:  cruse@usfca.edu
